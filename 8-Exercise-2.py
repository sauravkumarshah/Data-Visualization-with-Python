#4) Plot the HPAB against the year it occurred at 
#5) Have the line shown in green
ax.plot(data["Year"], HPAB, c="g")

#6) Show the plot
# plt.show()

#Create a second line plot that plots the at bat
#versus the year they occurred at.
#1) Using the above figure, add an a second axis to the 
#figure, and re-format the first subplot so that they
#stack on top of each other in two rows.

ax2 = fig.add_subplot(2,1,2)

#2) Plot the AB against the year it occurred at
#3) Have the line show in purple

#4) Show the plot

#Now we're going to adjust the figure to make both of the axes
#about square looking

#1. Adjust the figure height or width so that both axes look
#about square
